# Graphing-Calculator
Creation of a graphing calculator in Java with recursive descent parsing based on context-free grammar to convert data into a parsable tree. Created for WPI CS2103.


This program creates a graphing calculator in Java to produce a 2d graph from an equation. the program then takes the imput and creates a parsing tree based on context-free grammar rules simmilar to PEMDAS. this method of deconstructing an equation into its parts to more easily equate the answer has a vaiety of used past just doing simple math. This assignment makes use of inheritance and factoring out commonalities into helper functions. all methods are commented through javadocs above the method. restriction is held through out the program through use of most restrictive access motifiers <private,default,protected,public>  

this program can be used to graph functions using addition subtraction multipication division exponents parenthasis floating point numbers and the variable x with the proper evaluations for any combinations or order of those.
